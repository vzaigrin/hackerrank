# Array Of N Elements

## Problem
Create an array of n integers, where the value of n is passed as an argument to the pre-filled function in your editor. This challenge uses a custom checker, so you can create any array of n integers. For example, if n = 4, you could return [1, 1, 1, 1] or any other array of equal length.

## Input Format
A single integer, n.

## Output Format
The function must return an array, list, or vector of n integers. Stub code in the editor prints this to stdout as a space, comma, or semicolon-separated list (depending on your submission language).

**Note**: Your output need not match the Expected Output exactly; the size of your printed list is confirmed by a custom checker, which determines whether or not you passed each test case.

## Sample Input
10

## Sample Output
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 100
- The members returned by the list/vector/array must be integers

## Method Signature
-- Number Of Parameters: 1
-- Parameters: [n]
-- Returns: List or Vector
